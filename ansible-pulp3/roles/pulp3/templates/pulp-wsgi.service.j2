# This directive is set to an absolute path in other Pulp units. Using an
# absolute path is an abuse of the directive, as it should be a relative path,
# not an absolute path. PIDFile is now used to ensure that PID files are laid
# out in a standard way. If this directive had any other effects, it is better
# to use the correct directive than to uncomment this.
